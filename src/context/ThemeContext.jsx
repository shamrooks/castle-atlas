Let me explain the reasoning behind each part of this architecture:

1. **`/pages` Structure**
   - Each major route gets its own directory (Dashboard/, Profile/, etc.)
   - Using `index.jsx` in each directory follows the React convention for cleaner imports
   - Keeps page-specific components close to their parent page
   - Makes it easy to locate and maintain page-specific code
   ```
   Dashboard/
   ├── components/    # Components only used in Dashboard
   └── index.jsx     # Main Dashboard page logic
   ```

2. **`/lib` Directory**
   - Contains reusable utility functions and logic
   - `hooks.js`: Custom React hooks that can be reused across components
   - `constants.js`: Application-wide constants (API URLs, config values, etc.)
   - `validation.js`: Form and data validation functions
   - `analytics.js`: Analytics and tracking logic
   - Keeps business logic separate from UI components

3. **`/context` Directory**
   - Global state management using React Context
   - `ThemeContext`: Manages dark/light theme across the app
   - `ProgressContext`: Tracks user learning progress globally
   - Avoids prop drilling and centralizes state management

4. **`/utils` Directory**
   - Security-focused utilities
   - Separate from `/lib` because security functions often need special handling
   - Keeps security-related code isolated and easier to audit

5. **Root Configuration Files**
   - `.eslintrc.js`: Code style and quality rules
   - `.prettierrc`: Code formatting rules
   - `.env.example`: Template for environment variables
   - `docker-compose.yml`: Container configuration if needed

**Key Benefits:**
1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Each directory has a clear, single responsibility
   - Makes codebase easier to understand and maintain

2. **Scalability**
   - Structure supports growth without becoming messy
   - New features can be added without restructuring

3. **Reusability**
   - Common code is centralized and easily shared
   - Reduces duplication

4. **Maintainability**
   - Easy to find related code
   - Clear organization makes debugging simpler

5. **Testing**
   - Structure supports unit testing
   - Components are naturally isolated
